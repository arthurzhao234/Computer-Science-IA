The Program i've done as my IA project is for a maths teacher from another school.
Situation:
My client, Ms XIE, is a Chinese primary local school who is teaching maths. In the school system, students should hand in their exercise-books every morning and teachers have to give the feedback in the afternoon for students to correct in the evening. It leads to issues that make the system very inefficient: As some of the students may forget to hand in their exercise book or hand in late, it will take longer for teachers to check if someone hasn't handed it. What's more, it is still not sufficient enough to use teams since teams can only check if students hand in but it could not automatically check the students answer.

Ms Xie wants a thing that could help students and teachers to assign and do hoomework more effetively. For teahcers, they could add homework anytime and will be able to see the work from students whenever students have done their homework. This liberate teachers from marking the homework in school in order to give feedback.

solution
My solution is to create a program(website or software) for her to run on the computer. This helps the teacher to assign homework anytime on the program i
