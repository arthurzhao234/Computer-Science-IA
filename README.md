The Program i've done as my IA project is for a maths teacher from another school.
Situation:
My client, Ms XIE, is a Chinese primary local school who is teaching maths. One day, she emailed if i could help her to develope a system to solve a problem with assignment. I asked what specifically it was,and she said that in the school system, students have to hand in their exercise-books every morning and teachers have to give the feedback in the afternoon for students to correct in the evening. It leads to issues that make the system very inefficient as some of the students may forget to hand in their exercise book or hand in late, it will take longer for teachers to check if someone hasn't handed it. What's more, it is still not sufficient enough to use teams since teams can only check if students hand in but it could not automatically check the students answer. 
I asked:" why not just use teams?" She relied:"althoug teams has a very powerful system. It is very complicated for school to create a school email for ever students. Many issues may ouccur during that process. Since many students of mine are year 2&3 and they could not use email as efficiently as we do. What i need is a system that has a clear interface, function of account management, and basic functions like assign and check the work."

Conclusion
Ms Xie wants a thing that could help students and teachers to assign and do hoomework more effetively. For teahcers, they could add homework anytime and will be able to see the work from students whenever students have done their homework. This liberate teachers from marking the homework in school in order to give feedback.Teachers also intend to have a member management which they could add or remove students.

solution
My solution is to create a program(website or software) for her to run on the computer. This helps Ms Xie to assign homework anytime on the program, and also allow students to hand in anytime for Ms Xie to check. This, as a result, increase the efficiency of studying for both teachers and students.

Success criteria:
1.The System or the program needs a clear interface, so it will only have several elements,these including:
  two sign-in input box to login within accounts and passwords
  if you are a teacher, you will have options of creating questions, creating accounts and checking results from student
  if you are a student, you could answer the questions and see your results.
2.When teachers are creating accounts, they need to create an account and corresponding password and these two things will be stored in a check list for future use. Besides, when creating account name, it will check whether the name has been used.
3.For teachers, they could only create multiple choice questions, this is becuase every answer from students is automatically checked by the computer so it will be inaccurate for other types of questions. 
4.Each question will be stored in a file and for every account will have a copy of the file.
5.For students when they are solving th questions, they will be given four boxes to click on, their answers will be stored into a file and compare to the markscheme, then it will output a boolean to see if their answer is correct or not.
6.Teachers could check the students result by accessing their files, students could only see their own file and results.
7. the language i choose will be python because it could run effectively on MAC and it has a powerful GUI system
8. Some data structures will be use, such as array, queue stack etc
